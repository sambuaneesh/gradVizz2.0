- The bar chart visually represents the gender distribution among individuals in the dataset. Each bar in the chart corresponds to a gender category, namely "Male" and "Female." The length of each bar is proportional to the number of individuals belonging to that gender category.

- To enhance interactivity and provide additional information, hovering functionality is incorporated into the chart. When a user hovers over a bar, a tooltip appears, displaying the precise count of individuals for that gender category. This feature enables users to quickly and accurately identify the exact number of males and females in the dataset.

- Overall, the bar chart effectively communicates the gender distribution among individuals, offering both a visual representation and interactive functionality for detailed exploration of the data.
