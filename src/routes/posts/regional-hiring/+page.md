## Choropleth Analysis

### Introduction
The visualization utilizes a choropleth map to depict hiring variations across regions based on the number of graduates in each state. Hovering over states reveals specific information like state name and graduate count.

### Visualization Details
The map employs a color gradient, with darker shades indicating higher graduate numbers. Interactive hovering enhances user experience by providing detailed state-level data.

### Benefits and Applications
Valuable for policymakers, recruiters, and researchers to understand regional hiring trends. Policymakers can inform workforce policies, recruiters can target high-graduate regions, and researchers can address employment disparities.
