## Histogram Analysis

### Introduction

The histogram displays data on average scores, with the x-axis representing "Average Score" and the y-axis indicating "Frequency." Each bar on the histogram corresponds to a range or bin of average scores, showing the number of individuals falling within each score range.

### Understanding the Distribution Shape

The shape of the histogram offers insights into the distribution of scores. A symmetrical bell-shaped curve suggests a normal distribution, where most scores cluster around the average, while fewer scores are at the extremes. Conversely, a skewed distribution, where bars are lopsided to one side, indicates that scores tend to be higher or lower than the average.

### Observing the Score Range

By examining the x-axis, one can determine the minimum and maximum average scores observed in the dataset. The edges of the histogram illustrate the range within which the scores fall, providing an understanding of the score distribution.

### Assessing Score Spread

The width of the bins and the number of bars in the histogram reveal the spread of scores. Narrow bins with many bars indicate tightly clustered scores, while wider bins with fewer bars suggest a more spread-out distribution. This aspect helps gauge the variability or dispersion of scores within the dataset.

### Overall Interpretation

The histogram serves as a visual summary of the average score distribution, offering insights into how individuals performed on the test. It provides a comprehensive view of score frequency, distribution shape, score range, and spread, aiding in understanding the dataset's characteristics and performance patterns.
